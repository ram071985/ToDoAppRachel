**Summary**

This is my fifth project, created entirely with vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. Creating this To-Do List application has helped me develop a better understanding of both loops and arrays in JS. This was also the first application where I implemented local storage, which prevents the user's input items (their to-do list) from disappearing when they refresh the page.
